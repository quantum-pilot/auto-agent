## auto-agent

This was an experiment adapted from Dify's [official agent strategies](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-official-plugins/tree/main/agent-strategies/cot_agent) to support adaptive models (based on user selection), automatic summary, prompt and tool caching, rate limiting, etc., but I've ditched it in favor of using other technologies because this started becoming too much of a burden to maintain and easier solutions are available.
